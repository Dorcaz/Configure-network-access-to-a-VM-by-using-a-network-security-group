From Cloud Shell, run the following az vm create command to create a Linux VM:
az vm create \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --name my-vm \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys
  
  
  Run the following az vm extension set command to configure Nginx on your VM:
  az vm extension set \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --vm-name my-vm \
  --name customScript \
  --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions \
  --version 2.1 \
  --settings '{"fileUris":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-welcome-to-azure/master/configure-nginx.sh"]}' \
  --protected-settings '{"commandToExecute": "./configure-nginx.sh"}'
  
  This command uses the Custom Script Extension to run a Bash script on your VM. The script is stored on GitHub.
  
  
  
  In this procedure, you get the IP address for your VM and attempt to access your web server's home page.
  Run the following az vm list-ip-addresses command to get your VM's IP address and store the result as a Bash variable:
  IPADDRESS="$(az vm list-ip-addresses \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --name my-vm \
  --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress" \
  --output tsv)"
  
  
  
  Run the following curl command to download the home page:
  curl --connect-timeout 5 http://$IPADDRESS
  The --connect-timeout argument specifies to allow up to five seconds for the connection to occur.
  After five seconds, you see an error message that states that the connection timed out:

Output
curl: (28) Connection timed out after 5001 milliseconds
This message means that the VM was not accessible within the timeout period.
As an optional step, try to access the web server from a browser:
Run the following to print your VM's IP address to the console
Bash

echo $IPADDRESS

You see an IP address, for example, 23.102.42.235.
Open a new browser tab and go to your web server with the IP.


Run the following az network nsg list command to list the network security groups that are associated with your VM:
az network nsg list \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --query '[].name' \
  --output tsv
  
Output
my-vmNSG
  
Every VM on Azure is associated with at least one network security group. In this case, Azure created an NSG for you called my-vmNSG.
Run the following az network nsg rule list command to list the rules associated with the NSG named my-vmNSG:

az network nsg rule list \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --nsg-name my-vmNSG



Run the az network nsg rule list command a second time.
This time, use the --query argument to retrieve only the name, priority, affected ports, and access (Allow or Deny) for each rule.
The --output argument formats the output as a table so that it's easy to read.
  
  
 az network nsg rule list \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --nsg-name my-vmNSG \
  --query '[].{Name:name, Priority:priority, Port:destinationPortRange, Access:access}' \
  --output table
  
  You see this:
Output

Name               Priority    Port    Access
-----------------  ----------  ------  --------
default-allow-ssh  1000        22      Allow
  
  You see the default rule, default-allow-ssh. This rule allows inbound connections over port 22 (SSH). SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol that's used on Linux to allow administrators to access the system remotely.
The priority of this rule is 1000. Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers.
By default, a Linux VM's NSG allows network access only on port 22. This enables administrators to access the system. You need to also allow inbound connections on port 80, which allows access over HTTP.









Here, you create a network security rule that allows inbound access on port 80 (HTTP).

Run the following az network nsg rule create command to create a rule called allow-http that allows inbound access on port 80:

az network nsg rule create \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --nsg-name my-vmNSG \
  --name allow-http \
  --protocol tcp \
  --priority 100 \
  --destination-port-ranges 80 \
  --access Allow
  
  
  To verify the configuration, run az network nsg rule list to see the updated list of rules:
  
az network nsg rule list \
  --resource-group learn-b9f052e5-f764-4e32-a300-2ce0088d7e94 \
  --nsg-name my-vmNSG \
  --query '[].{Name:name, Priority:priority, Port:destinationPortRange, Access:access}' \
  --output table
  
  You see this both the default-allow-ssh rule and your new rule, allow-http:

Output

Copy
Name               Priority    Port    Access
-----------------  ----------  ------  --------
default-allow-ssh  1000        22      Allow
allow-http         100         80      Allow


Access your web server again
Now that you've configured network access to port 80, let's try to access the web server a second time.

Run the same curl command that you ran earlier:


curl --connect-timeout 5 http://$IPADDRESS
You see this:

HTML

<html><body><h2>Welcome to Azure! My name is my-vm.</h2></body></html>

As an optional step, refresh your browser tab that points to your web server.
